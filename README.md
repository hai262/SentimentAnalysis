# ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
The Sentiment Analysis project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify textual data into sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). This project helps organizations gauge public opinion, monitor brand sentiment, and make data-driven decisions based on customer feedback.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Automated cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization of text data.
- **Sentiment Classification:** Implementation of machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks) to predict sentiment.
- **Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs to display sentiment distribution and model performance.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly Streamlit web interface for real-time analysis and visualization.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle large datasets for robust sentiment analysis.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Natural Language Processing:** NLTK, SpaCy, TextBlob
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
